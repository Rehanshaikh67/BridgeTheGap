          <h2>Online Coaching</h2>
          <p>
            Remote coaching gives you the flexibility to train on your own
            schedule with expert guidance wherever you live. I’ll design a
            customised programme based on your goals, current ability and
            equipment access, blending therapeutic exercise and strength
            training to advance you safely and effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout each month you’ll receive regular check‑ins, video
            feedback and modifications to keep you progressing. This option is
            ideal if you have recently finished physical therapy and want to
            continue building strength and confidence or if you simply prefer
            to train independently with ongoing support.
          </p>

          <ul>

               and value framing. -->
